<H3>What&#180;s THE HINT LIBRARY ?</H3>
<P><BR></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With The Hint Library you can create and read hint collection files.
Originally the intention was  to build electronical versions of the INFOCOM
InivisiClues(tm). These were tiny books with hints for the famous 
textadventures of Infocom (e.g. The Hitchhiker&#180;s Guide to the Galaxy ).
They provided encrypted hints to several riddles of the games sorted by topics.
In contrast to ordinary walkthroughs these hints offered an alternate &quot;soft&quot;
way of help. With the rise of the multimedia age a milestone in computer history
ended. In 1990 Infocom died. But even today there are many fans of the Infocom
adventures left. After Infocom&#180;s end the games and hintsbooks disappeard
from the market. To avoid loosing the information of the hintbooks forever, they
were collected and published at different sources in the Internet for
non-commercial use only. The main disadvantage was that normal text files cannot
provide a soft way of help where each user himself/herself decides when to get
help and in which level of detail.  The answer was a electronical resurrection.
While developing the system the concept advanced to an open system  which can be
used to create hint collection in general ( by this way it is possible to
immortalize the work of other famous adventure programmers like Magnetic Scrolls
). Therefore a file format was created which connects text, pictures and
multimedia files. The software itself provides a &quot;reader&quot; part and an &quot;editor&quot;
part.</P>
<P>The aim of this project is to build up a library of hint collections which
can be used by everyone and for free. by the way everyone is invited to take
part in this project and to make his/her most favourite hints availble to other
users. </P>
<P><BR>Enjoy THE HINT LIBRARY !</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
