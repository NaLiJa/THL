THL - The Hint Library
----------------------

THL was an early attempt of a hint system for games, mostly interactive fiction
and adventure games. It was developed around 1996-1998 using Borland Delphi 2.

This repo contains the recently recovered sources for THL. The system did not reach
a bigger audience, however, the distribution and hint files are still around, for
example at the interactive fiction archive. So, these sources hopefully ensure future 
access to the hints, aside from that the repo is mainly here for historical reference.

The folders contain:

**hint_reader.10**

Delphi source project for THL 1.0. There are the compiled binaries included as well, without the installer.
The binaries still seem to work on recent Windows systems.

**hint_reader.11**

Same as above, only for THL 1.1

**HOMEPAGE.THL**

A small THL website, in memory of times when a 1,2 MB download was quite huge...

**THL_FILES**

Contains both the raw text files in thr format and the binary thl versions, that were distributed.
For editing, please note, that media links were unfortunately stored with absolute paths. It might necessary to edit the thr files in a text editor to adapt the paths before opening in  THL.

With some minor fixes, it was possible to build the project with the latest Delphi CE 
edition. Although it did not fully work, it could probably be recovered into a modern executable if there is any need.

This was one of my very first encounters with Delphi, so expect some code mess and bugs that were never caught :-)
Enoy the blast from the past.
