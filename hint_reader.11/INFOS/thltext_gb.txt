The Hint Library 1.1
--------------------

Walkthroughs often provide more information than you need to solve
the problem you´re stuck in.
The Hint Library just gives you the help you need to solve the special
problem.

THL files consist of hints on several problems you encounter during
a game. The are ordered by topics and provide either slight help or
detailed answers. So it´s up to you how much help you get.
The THL file format supports text, images (BMP,JPG,TGA,PCX,...), and
multimedia files (WAV,MID,AVI,MOV,...).

The software contains a reader for getting hints from existing THL files
and an editor for creating new THL files.

The Hint Library is distributed as FREEWARE. You may use the software without
charge and distribute to others.

Now release 1.1 is available with many new features e.g. links between
topics or hints.

The Hint Library is running on Windows NT/95. There are german and
english releases available so far.
