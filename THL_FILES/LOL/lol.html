<H1><A NAME="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>

<P>
This walkthrough gives explicit instructions on playing LANDS
OF LORE (LOL) to a successful conclusion. It does, however, assume
you have read the Game Manual and Lands of Lore Book and are familiar
with the various methods of controlling your characters' actions.
You also have to be able to refer to the maps referenced by this
walkthrough.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="Maps">MAPS</A></H1>

<P>
Throughout the walkthrough, my directions depend on your being
able to reference certain maps. The maps were created by Patricia
H. (CompuServe ID: 71700,2130.) and are contained in her hints
file LANDMAP.ZIP, in the CRPG Library (9) of the CompuServe Gamers
Forum. I have also made them available here. I assume you are
able to display the maps using an application such as Paint Shop
Pro, while you are playing LOL via MS-Windows task switching.
Alternatively, you may make hard copies of the maps, by printing
at about 200% of scale. Patricia does not guarantee the maps are
100% complete. (I found only very minor omissions and errors.)
Most maps have several numbers on them. I refer to these numbers
throughout the walkthrough to guide you through each zone.
<P>
Each zone you will encounter in LOL is listed below. Selecting
a zone in the list will display the corresponding map.

<P>
In the early stages of the walkthrough I will be more explicit
than later on. There are many items to pick up . . . far too many
to mention . . . so I only point out the very important items.
Many doors and niches are opened by operating obvious buttons
or switches. Later on, I assume the player has the hang of this
and I do not tell you how to open the straightforward doors.
<P>
Similarly, as the game progresses you will become familiar with
the different zones and the important locations within them. So
I only give you general directions on traveling from one location
to another across different zones.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="Suggestions">SUGGESTIONS</A></H1>

<OL>
<LI>Start off each new zone by exploring without trying to solve
the puzzles, but killing all the monsters you come across. You
should then have most, if not all, of the zone mapped (by the
automap feature) and most, if not all, of the monsters eliminated.
This will show you where all the switches and buttons are that
you may not have noticed and you will have a much easier time
solving the puzzles, without distractions.
<LI>When you come across acid spitting creatures, remove your
armor or it may be destroyed. You can recover, your armor will
not!
<LI>Try customizing use of your three main characters to be each
expert in a particular skill; make one an expert fighter, one
an expert mage and one an expert rogue. But make sure they are
all reasonable fighters and magicians. I found Bacatta made the
best rogue, while Paulson is a good fighter. This means your main
character should be strong in magic. This may make Michael seem
a poor choice, but it just means that selecting Michael will make
your party more dependent on fighting ability and much less on
magic.
<LI>When a character is poisoned let his health drop to nothing.
Then use the heal spell on him and he will no longer be poisoned.
<LI>A weapon's effectiveness depends on the creature you are fighting,
so try out different weapons.
<LI>Use the freeze spell on the rock monsters.
<LI>Poison gas areas can not be avoided, but you can minimize
the effects by running through them.
<LI>Don't despair when you get to those really nasty places where
the monsters may defeat you far too easily. Save often and you
will gradually progress through White Tower Level 3 and Cimmeria
Castle Dungeon.

<H1><A NAME="OpeningScenes">OPENING SCENE</A>S</H1>

<P>
A messenger races on horseback toward Gladstone Keep. The portcullis
rises to let the messenger enter. The messenger hands a scroll
to Geron, who is talking with King Richard. Scotia has uncovered
the temple in the Urbish Mines, where the nether mask is located.
Scotia must be destroyed.
<P>
Scotia's creature finds the nether mask and delivers it to his
mistress. She destroys him and gloats over the pretty package.
She now has the ability to take on other forms.
<P>
King Richard summons his champion . . . you! You may pick one
of four guises: Kieran, Ak'shel, Michael or Conrad. This walkthrough
will work with any of these characters.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="NorthlandsAndSouthlands">NORTHLANDS &amp; SOUTHLANDS</A>
</H1>

<H2>GLADSTONE KEEP</H2>

<P>
Go to the Throne Room (4). Take note of your instructions. Go
to Geron's Office (2) to get the King's Writ. Go to the King's
Library (3) opening the lock with the key. Check the books. One
of these books is the Magic Atlas (or Automap). Don't leave before
you have access to the Automap. Go to Victor's Arms (5). Buy the
mace, selling the dagger if you wish. Leave via (1) for the Northlands
Forest.
<H2>NORTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
Get some experience killing monsters before going too much further.
You will also find many useful weapons and other items in the
woods, so pick them up.
<P>
Go to the Thugs' Hideout (5). Attack the thugs. When you have
killed them enter the cave.
<H2>THUGS' HIDEOUT</H2>

<P>
Open the wall using the lever. Pick up the lantern at (2). Press
the button at (3) and take the thugs' key. At (4) take the rock
off the east pressure plate and put it with another rock on the
west pressure plate to open the wall. Walk to the end of the hidden
passage, placing another rock on the pressure plate, and press
all three buttons (north, south and west) to open the wall. Open
the chest at (5) with the thugs' key. Take the lock picks, bezel
cup, salve and coins. Return to the cave entrance at (1).
<H2>NORTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
Return to Gladstone Keep.
<H2>GLADSTONE KEEP</H2>

<P>
Go to Victor's Arms (5) and sell some of the arms you have picked
up. You should keep, or trade for, at least the best three items
of every different piece of equipment as you will have up to three
different characters in your party at anytime. Leave the keep
via (1).
<H2>NORTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
Go to the Marina at (4). Hand over the King's Writ and you will
travel to the Southlands Forest.
<H2>SOUTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
Go to the Grey Eagle Inn at (2). Check out the back room and the
guest will give you the Compass. Then talk to the man with blond
hair at the bar. When you leave, Timothy will join your party.
Equip him from your inventory. Visit Buck's Skins at (3) to buy
the boots. Then go to Roland's Manor at (4).
<H2>ROLAND'S MANOR</H2>

<P>
Go to the Fireplace at (3). Take and read the burnt scroll. Go
to the hidden niche at (4) and take the oil flasks and aloe. Go
to (2). Save before tackling the ogre. The best method to use
here is to bluff and hope he falls for it and leaves. Otherwise
attack! Open the wall to reveal Sir Roland. Unlock his chest with
the key and take the coins and saber. Now you have enough money,
return to Buck's Skins at (3) and buy the bow and shield. Return
to the forest at (1).
<H2>SOUTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
Return to the Marina at (1)
<H2>NORTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
Go to Gladstone Keep at (1)
<H2>GLADSTONE KEEP</H2>

<P>
Place all of Timothy's equipment in the inventory. Return to the
Throne Room at (4). Witness the Scotia/Richard/Dawn scene. Notice
the fallen cup. Notice Scotia's threat to Dawn. Then note the
configuration of the protective magical shield surrounding Richard.
Talk to the red haired man Paulson and he will tell you that he
is going to the Urbish Mines. Dawn will give you a Spell book
and Baccata will join your party in place of Timothy. Equip Baccata.
Visit Victor's Arms at (5) if you have equipment to sell. Leave
the Keep via (1).
<H2>NORTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
It is a good idea to have two spare daggers with you before you
enter the Draracle's Cave at (2)<HR>

<H1><A NAME="DraraclesCave">DRARACLE'S CAVE</A></H1>

<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
The gold switch will open a wall. Go to the three buttons at (2).
Press each of them and some of the pits will close. Go to (3),
walking on quickly past the pressure plate that opens the door,
and placing a weight (rock) on the pressure plate to disarm the
trap. At (5) notice the broken wall. Return past the trap and
open the door by weighting down the pressure plate. Defeat the
monsters, enter their hideout and take what you need. Return to
the pits and jump down.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
After your fall, take the sledgehammer from the eastern corner.
Open the wall with the button on the north wall. Go down to the
pod room at (2). Rescue Lora from the rightmost pod and equip
her. Open the way out by pressing the button on the east wall.
Go up to level 1 via the trap door.
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Go back to the broken wall at (5) and break it down using the
sledgehammer. Then break down the wall at (6). By now you should
have killed the ratman carrying the emerald eye in the (7) area.
If not, seek him out and take the emerald. When you reach the
dead end, operate the switch to open the wall. This will reveal
a pit. Jump into the pit.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
Go to the chest at (3) and unlock it with the lock picks. Here
you will find the sapphire eye. Open the door by pushing the button
to the left of the door at (4). Insert the emerald eye in the
eastern dragon eye socket. Insert the sapphire eye in the northern
dragon eye socket.
<P>
You make take one of two paths at this point. To progress with
the game you need only play through one of the paths. You may
skip either the Emerald Path or the Sapphire Path, or return to
the dragon eyes intersection after taking one path so you can
take the other.
<H2>SAPPHIRE PATH</H2>

<P>
Go north from the dragons eyes intersection. Open the chest at
(5) with the lock picks. Go to the chest at (6) passing through
the secret wall, and open it with the lock picks. In particular,
here you will find a freeze spell scroll and a silver goblet.
(7) is a fireball trap . . . don't operate the switch. Shoot or
throw something at the button at (8) to close the pit and take
the worn key from the niche. Take the stairs down to level 3.
<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
The keyhole at (1) opens with the worn key. There is another freeze
spell scroll in the secret niche at (3) but it is useless if you
have already have one. Return to (1) and walk over the pit at
(4) (it is an illusion) and onto the chest at (6). Pick up the
iron key at (5), then operate the switch that opens the wall.
( I didn't find a use for the iron key, so you can discard it.)
Go through the secret wall to the axe at (7). Return through the
secret wall and to the saber at (8).
<H2>EMERALD PATH</H2>

<H3>LEVEL 2</H3>

<P>
Go east from the dragons eyes intersection. Go to the niche at
(5) via the secret wall. Go to the pit at (7). Throw or shoot
something at the button across the pit and the pit will close.
You can now take the coins and dagger near the stairs.
<P>
Go to the niche and button at (8). The note reads &quot;Dagger
in . . . Dagger out.&quot;. First put a dagger in the niche, then
press the button. Operate the gold horns and then push the button.
Pick the lock with the lock picks, then push the button. Put another
dagger in the niche, then push the button and the wall opens.
Walk through the opening and smash the chest with the sledgehammer.
You will find, a helm, a freeze spell scroll and a jeweled dagger.
<P>
Return to the pit at (7) and go down the stairs to level 3.
<H3>LEVEL 3</H3>

<P>
Go to the hidden niche and button at (1). Get the iron key at
(2). (I didn't find a use for this key so you may discard it.)
Go to the pit at (3). It is an illusion. Open the chest with the
lock picks.
<H2>EMERALD AND SAPPHIRE PATHS JOIN</H2>

<P>
Go to the chest at (5, EMERALD PATH map), open with the lock picks
or the iron key from SAPPHIRE PATH (5).In particular, take the
red key. Open the red lock at (9, SAPPHIRE PATH map) with the
red key. Go down the stairs to level 4.
<H2>LEVEL 4</H2>

<P>
Go to the chest at (4) and open it with the lock picks. Then walk
toward (1). Place weights on the pressure plates to turn off the
fireball traps. When you get to the dead end, operate the crooked
brick to open the wall. Go to (1) and open the chest with the
lock picks. In particular, take the bezel ring and wear it. The
switch at (3) sort of controls the fireball traps. I couldn't
stop them, so kept having to heal my party after each zap! Collect
the things in the niche at (7). Then take the stairs up to level
3.
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
Place Lora's equipment in the inventory. Pick up the silver goblet
or the jeweled dagger before entering the cave. Walk into the
alcove on the left and place the &quot;trinket&quot; in the golden
chest. The Draracle will give you a riddle scroll which lists
the ingredients for the elixir which will cure King Richard. He
also tells you that the elixir must be mixed in a tower. Lora
stays with the Draracle.
<P>
When you exit the Draracle's Lair you end up on level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
Walk on up to level 1.
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Walk on, operating the switch to open the wall. Return to the
exit to Northlands Forest.
<H2>NORTHLANDS FOREST</H2>

<P>
On the way to Gladstone Keep you will encounter Timothy. Gladstone
Keep has fallen. You must make your way across Lake Dread to the
Opinwood.
<P>
Head for Lake Dread at (3). Victor tells you that Dawn has crossed
Lake Dread and you are able to go across by the same boat.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="OpinwoodForest"></A><A HREF="#OpinwoodForest2">OPINWOOD FOREST</A>
</H1>

<P>
Find the Gorkha Swamp entrance at (1), then go and open the chest
at (2) with the lock picks. Then making your way through the secret
walls find the entrance at (6) for the Urbish Mines. Go to (7)
and pick up the long sword and at (8) get the green skull out
of the gnarled tree. Visit the beggar at (3) and give him some
money. This act of charity will pay off later! Open the chest
at (9) with the lock picks. Here you will find the lightning spell
scroll. Finally visit the wagon at (4) but you won't be able prove
to Droek that you are comrades of Dawn yet. Return to the Gorkha
Swamp entrance at (1) and enter the swamp.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="GorkhaSwamp">GORKHA SWAMP</A></H1>

<P>
Note: Remember to run through the swamp gas areas but don't fall
in the pits!
<P>
You probably have a very cluttered inventory right now and would
appreciate selling off some of the equipment you don't need. If
you have a couple of free slots visit the chest at (2) first.
(If not, return to (2) later.) Open the chest with the lock picks.
Wear the Duble Ring.
<P>
Now go to the fletcher at (6) and sell your excess equipment.
Remember to keep enough, and the best you currently have, for
three people.
<P>
Go to the Witch Doctor at (7). Have him translate the Riddle Scroll
for you. You may also buy some fireball wands here to help in
your fight against the Dark Army monsters.
<P>
In your inventory, you should have an empty flask. If so, collect
some swamp water in it. If not, do so when you have an empty flask.
<P>
Go to the chest at (3) and open it with the lock picks.
<P>
Now go to the Gorkha Chieftain at (4). Put all of your weapons
in your inventory on the Gorkha's guard's order. Continue on to
(4). When you see the Gorkha Chieftain, look at the necklace with
the red stone. The chieftain will offer to trade with you. Offer
him anything from your inventory and he will refuse but challenge
you to find the Gorkha's brass ceremonial helmet which has been
stolen by the stickmen.
<P>
Re-equip your party with weapons. Go to the area at (9). You will
have to freeze many of the swamp pits to get past them. In this
area, you should kill a stickman and recover the ceremonial helmet
from him. Go to (8) and pick up the bow. Nearby, east of the pits
is a blacksmith. You can buy and sell arms here.
<P>
Now return to the Gorkha chieftain at (4). Hand over the brass
ceremonial helmet and receive the ruby of truth in exchange.
<P>
To complete exploration of the swamp, go to (5) and pick up the
glint mail and at (10) you will find the entrance to Upper Opinwood
Forest.
<P>
Return to (1) and enter Opinwood Forest again.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="OpinwoodForest2"></A><A HREF="#OpinwoodForest3">OPINWOOD FOREST</A>
</H1>

<P>
Visit Dawn at (4). Now you hold the Ruby of Truth, Dawn will talk
with you. Show her the riddle scroll and she will help translate
it and give you some empty flasks for the ingredients. (You only
need two empty flasks altogether, which you will fill later.)
She will also give you her pyramid key.
<P>
Where next? Well remember Paulson was going to the Urbish Mines?
It might be an idea to have him join you and reinforce your party.
So go to the Urbish Mine entrance at (6).<HR>

<H1><A NAME="UrbishMine">URBISH MINE</A></H1>

<H2>OFFICE LEVEL</H2>

<P>
Go to (2) and use the green skull several times on the giant slug.
Pick up your weapons. Go to (3) and you will notice that the mining
offices provide you with a short cut between Upper Opinwood Forest
and Opinwood Forest.
<P>
Explore all the office drawers and filing cabinets to stock up
on supplies and you will also find a fireball spell scroll.
<P>
To get to (4), close the outer door in order to open the inner
door. At (5) there is a machine that needs fueling and repairing.
The keyhole at (6) opens with the lock picks. Talk to the clerk
at (7). Take the pick axe and great helm.
<P>
When you have thoroughly explored the offices, go down the stairs
to level 1.
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Open the silver keyhole at (1) with the silver key. Walk past
the wheels at (2) and push the button on the west wall to open
a pit. Jump down the pit to level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
Push the button and you will drop to level 3!
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
Take the silver key from the niche at (4) and open the silver
lock at (7). The note at (5) is a red herring! Cast fire balls
at the nests at (6). Go through the secret wall to (11).
<P>
Open the chest using the lock picks. Use the yellow jewel in the
plate to open the door to the mine car. You need to go to (13)
so must take the mine car straight on at the junction. Both levers
should be up. Get in the mine car and click to go straight on.
<P>
Operate the switch on the east wall to open the wall. Operate
the switch on the north wall to open the wall. Go to (13) and
use the pick axe on the coal seam. Put a piece of coal in your
inventory. (This is fuel for the machine on the office level at
(4).)
<P>
Return to (11) via the mine car. This time you want to go right
to (12) and the stairs down. Set the left lever down and take
the mine car to the right.
<P>
Pick the copper keyhole with the lock picks at (12) and go down
the stairs to level 4.
<H2>LEVEL 4</H2>

<P>
At the bottom of the stairs, push the button to make the teleport
appear. Walk into the teleport.
<P>
Keep one of the red hearts from the rock monsters. This is another
ingredient for the elixir.
<P>
Break though the rock pile at (2) with the pick axe. Search the
bones at (1) for a rusty key.
<P>
Go to (11) and get the gear from Hank's bones. This is needed
to repair the machine on the office level at (4).
<P>
Go to the teleport area to the east of the wheels. Take the teleport
to the stairs up to level 3.
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
Return via the mine car to the teleport at (3). Walk into the
teleport and it will take you to the office level.
<H2>OFFICE LEVEL</H2>

<P>
Go to the machine at (5). Place the coal in the machine and repair
it with the gear. Operate the lever.
<P>
Go down the stairs to level 1
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Go to the wheels at (2). Set the south wheel so that the knob
is down and the north wheel so that the knob is up. Walk into
the teleport and you will go to level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
You will arrive in a part of level 2 you haven't seen before.
You can move in four different directions through secret walls
that surround you.
<P>
First, go south, then west. Weight the pressure plate to open
the niche. Take mine key 4. Return to the room surrounded by secret
walls.
<P>
Next, go west and unlock the silver keyhole with mine key 4. Go
south. Notice the stairs down at (7) and get the long sword at
(13). Return to the room surrounded by secret walls.
<P>
Next go north. Open the chests at (5) and (6) with the lock picks.
Return to the room surrounded by secret walls.
<P>
Next go east. First go to (10). I found running over the flaming
pits was easiest and healing your party when you get to (10).
(I'm sure there is a way of turning all the fire pits off by weighting
the pressure plates somehow but I didn't bother figuring this
out.) At (10) there is a fireball wand. Now go to (8), the smell
of gas. Stand back a square or two, and cast a fireball into the
gas. This will release hordes of the blue electrical wispy creatures.
I found the best way to deal with these creatures was to run away
and deal with them one or two at a time, run away, heal, save,
then seek them out. It took quite a while to get them all. I used
a combination of the green skull, long sword, crossbow and the
Gorkha's trident. When you finally get to the niche beyond the
gas smell, take mine key 5.

<P>
You enter at (6). Collect the dagger at (7). Go to (4) and fill
an empty flask with honey from the hornet's nest. This is another
ingredient of the elixir.
<P>
Next go to (3) and open the chest with the lock picks. The crossbow
'Valkyrie' is a great weapon. Don't lose it! Now go to (2) and
you will encounter Scotia.
<P>
If you are collecting too many weapons, go to (12), the Gorkha
Swamp entrance, sell your excess arms to the fletcher in the Gorkha
Swamp. Return to Upper Opinwood.
<P>
Next go to (10). Open the chest with the lock picks. The emerald
blade is good for killing wraiths. Now go to (11). Open the chest
with lock picks. Put the jade necklace on one of your characters
to increase his rogue skills.
<P>
I also came across a worn key (I found no use for it.) after killing
a skeleton warrior in the north west of Upper Opinwood, south
of Scotia's barrier.
<P>
Now go back to (2) where Scotia has put her barrier to keep you
out of her way. Use the Vaelan's cube on the barrier a couple
of times.<HR>

<P>
You enter Yvel City at (1). Go to (2), enter the house and pick
up the Ace of Dominion. Then go to (3) and you will meet Victor
again. Sell him any excess equipment and buy the great sword.
The sword is an excellent weapon.
<P>
Now go to (4) and pry the boards off the door. Enter the house.
Pick up the speckled key and the hand of fate spell scroll. Go
next to (5) and take the Dwarvish plate mail.
<P>
Next go to (6). This is Sadie's shop. Show her the riddle scroll
and she will give you the last ingredient for the elixir. Outside,
you can drop the riddle scroll. Now go to (16) and (17). Open
both chests with the lock picks.
<P>
Now go to (19). Take the Ace of Oblivion. Now go to (14) and take
the aegis helm. Then go to (13) and get another aegis helm. Next
go to (10) where there is a crossbow. Go on to (11). Open the
lock with the speckled key. In the house there is a jade key (which
only opens an empty house, so discard it) a great helm, plate
mail and a shield. Now go to (12). Pick the lock.
<P>
Visit the Yvel Council at (9). Not much here, except a hint that
Richard is at Castle Cimmeria.
<P>
You probably need to lighten your load by now. Visit the fletcher
at (15) and/or Victor at (3) to sell off some of your equipment.

<P>
To make more space in your inventory go to (11). Open the door
with the brighter of the mystic keys. Leave the four ingredients
for elixir in this room, not too near the altar. (I found I lost
them if I was close to the altar.) You can pick them up later
when you are ready to make the elixir here. You can also leave
the two yellow pyramid keys here, but you must take them with
you when you leave the White Tower with the elixir.
<P>
Go up the western stairs to level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
The following sequence of events are harrowing and of questionable
reward. I suggest you go through it for the fun of it anyway!
<P>
Re-enter (7) the pit room. From the entry square, just past the
door, do the following: Go north, east twice, north twice and
west twice. Take the mystic key and push the button in the west
wall. Now go east twice, south twice, west and south twice. Press
the button in the south wall. Use the mystic key, you just found,
to unlock the west door. Go, carefully, to the secret wall and
go through it. The long wall contains four switches. The first
three you come to, may turn off the seemingly endless supply of
flying fireball chickens. The fourth switch turns on the fireball
cannon.
<P>
At (4) there is a helm. Now retrace your steps. Was it worth it?
<P>
Go to (2), the fireball room. (The fireball cannons fire only
when you step on to a square facing them.) Go to the north west
niche and get the mystic key. Go to (9). Use the brighter mystic
key in the lock.
<P>
Go up the stairs to level 3.
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
NOTE: There are two (6)s on the map. I refer to the chest at (6)
and the pit at (6) to distinguish between them.
<P>
Heed the ghost's warning, but soldier on! The spirits are very
bad here, but can be beaten by luring them out . . . it is do-able!
Go to (2), push the button on the floor and get the mystic key.
Now go to the lock at (3) and use the mystic key you just found
to open it. Open the chest at (4) with the lock picks.
<P>
Open the switch at (5). Open the north door and go through the
secret wall. Open the chest at (6) with the lock picks. Now go
to the pit at (6) and fall through it to level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
You will find yourself in the minotaur's room (3). Defeat the
minotaur and use the horn as the key to open the west wall. Go
to the stairs up to level 3.
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
Return to the pit at (6) and close it by pushing the button and
shooting or throwing something at the button beyond the pit. Open
the chest at (7) with lock picks. Go through the secret wall to
(8). Open the chest with the lock picks and, in particular, get
a blue mystic key.
<P>
Go to (9). Use the non-blue mystic key to open the door. Take
the ivory key from the niche. The pressure plate at (10) allows
you to get to the secret wall. Go through the secret wall to find
some more supplies.
<P>
Return to the stairs and go down to level 2. Then go down the
stairs to level 1.
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Open the lock at (13) with the ivory key. Go down the stairs to
the basement.
<H2>BASEMENT</H2>

<P>
Put each of the four items moving around the central square at
(1) in the one of the four niches around the central square. Three
of the niches are on the inner walls, one is on an outer wall.
Do not place the items in niches outside the central square. Open
the lock at (2) with the blue mystic key.
<P>
After you have supplied the password, the old lady will give you
the crucible of faith.
<P>
Collect the equipment from the niche on your way to the stairs
up to level 1. Try not to use the wand of death until your final
confrontation with Scotia.
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Go to the Altar de Blanca at (11). Place the crucible of faith
on the altar Pick up the ingredients for the elixir and place
them in the crucible. Put the crucible in your inventory. If you
dropped anything else here, pick it up before leaving.
<P>
If you want still more choices of equipment, you may return to
level 3 and enter the room at the door of faith (13). You can
open only one of the chests.
<P>
Return to the Yvel Woods, (1) on level 1 and go to Yvel City at
(5).<HR>

<P>
Visit Victor at (3) to unload your excess equipment once again.
Visit the council at (9). Geron tells you to fetch Dawn, so you
must return to the Opinwood.
<P>
Leave the city at (1) and go to (1) on the Yvel Woods map. Scotia
will appear to you as you enter the Upper Opinwood in Dawn's form.
Leave when you encounter her. Go to the Urbish Mines at (6) on
the Upper Opinwood Map. Next go to (3) on the Urbish Mine map.
<HR>

<H1><A NAME="OpinwoodForest3"></A>OPINWOOD FOREST</H1>

<P>
Go to (4) in the Opinwood Forest. By the time you arrive, Droek's
wagon has been attacked and Dawn is not here. Return to Yvel City.
<HR>

<H1><A NAME="YvelCity3"></A>YVEL CITY</H1>

<P>
Go to the Yvel Council at (9). Geron will tell you that the city
militia has fallen and the three of you are on your own to defend
the city! Find yourselves a cozy nook (such as right outside the
Yvel Council house) where you can only be attacked on one side
and keep killing the members of the Dark Army until the initial
onslaught is over. Then you will have to seek out the enemy. Keep
killing the monsters and eventually, the Dark Army will retreat.
<P>
When the Dark Army has retreated, return to the Yvel Council at
(9). Read the note. Go to Bruno's Inn at (7). Go through the open
door at the back of the inn. Press the button on the north wall
and the wall will open revealing a cave. Go into the cave.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="CatwalkCaves">CATWALK CAVES</A></H1>

<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Go to (1) and kill Mylek, First Envoy of the Dark Path. Take Geron's
key and the dark gauntlet. Put the statuette on the pedestal (near
to (1)). This will open the east wall. The button on the south
wall will open a niche. Use the dark gauntlet in the hand impression
on the west wall and the west wall will open. Walk on until you
reach hand impressions in the north and west walls. Open both
with the dark gauntlet.
<P>
Go west and make you way to (2). The button on the walls will
get you past the first set of pits. Activate the teleport by using
weights and stepping on and off the north pressure plate. The
pressure plate toggles the teleport on and off.
<P>
Now go the chest at (5) and open it with the lock picks. Here,
in particular, you will find the mist of doom spell scroll and
a yellow key.
<P>
Next go to (4). To get the replicator to work you must herd one
of the spark creatures down each of three hallways. They will
power the replicator. If you don't need to replicate anything
(you shouldn't need to) and are finding the spark creatures a
nuisance, you can kill them with the spark spell.
<P>
Now return to the two hand impressions adjacent to each other
by continuing clockwise round the map and take the north route.
Make your way through the secret wall and spinner area to (7).
A dark army warrior will drop a blue key when you kill him in
this area. Use the key to open the chest at (8).
<P>
Go to the keyholes at (9) and open the left-hand lock with the
yellow key and the right-hand lock with the small key. Inside
this room, you will meet the Knowles and the Xeobs. They each
want you to be their champion and wipe out the other group. They
will reward you generously should you succeed. There is no getting
out of this. Both groups are very difficult to kill but it can
be done with perseverance! However, when you find the key to,
and location of, your 'allies' headquarters you can turn on them
and kill them . . . but no reward! First, you must pick a side.
The Knowles will reward you with increased magic skills, while
the Xeobs will increase your fighting skills. Pick a side, then
walk into the appropriate teleport.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
The map is missing the section of level 2 you fall to from the
southerly pits on level 1.
<P>
There is nothing useful here. Either teleport up to level 1 or
take the stairs. The area where there is a teleport has a door
and button. There is something moving behind the door but I could
not open the door.<HR>

<H1><A NAME="CastleCimmeria">CASTLE CIMMERIA</A></H1>

<H2>DUNGEON</H2>

<P>
You have teleported to the dungeon of Castle Cimmeria. Explore
the entire area. Try to find lone enemies or run away when you
start getting weak to heal somewhere in safety.
<P>
There are niches at (2) and (17). The copper key at (3) opens
the door to the teleport at (13) which takes you to the Knowles
(if you are supporting them). The gold key, at (15), is used to
visit the Xeobs similarly, at (4). There are chests with supplies
at (6), (10), (14), (16) and (18). Make sure you get the diamond
in the chest at (10). There is a yellow key in the hidden niche
at (17) but I found no use for it.
<P>
When you either defeat the Knowles or the Xeobs you will get a
key to the castle and a Vaelan's cube. Use the key at (11). Go
up the stairs to level 1.
<H2>LEVEL 1</H2>

<P>
Go to (2). The wall in front of the stairs down to the dungeon
will close behind you, but later you will be able to open it.
At (2) you will find Dawn in a crystal ball. Free her by using
the diamond on the sphere. Dawn will leave to get reinforcements.
<P>
Go to (4) and pick up the small key.
<P>
Go to (7), open the niche and take the cobra figurine. You will
have to jump into the pit to the dungeon. Return to the stairs
up to Level 1. Open the wall by pushing the button on the west
wall.
<P>
Now go to (5). Push the button to make the teleport appear. Walk
into the teleport. You will find yourselves in the southern section
of Level 1. Go to (11) and do not flip any switches along the
hallway. The teleports will take you to the middle of area (13).
Don't panic! You have lost your automap, but it will return when
you leave this area. This is a spin and pit area. Avoid the pits
and put weights on the pressure plates whenever you come across
them. There are two aims. The first is to get the dragon figurine
from (12). The second aim is to pass through the secret south
wall to the stairs up to level 2. The compass will help you, but
you must let it settle down.
<P>
Once you have found the dragon figurine and found the stairs,
go up to level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
If you come across the niche at (2), do not put anything in it
unless you want to lose that item! Go to the chest at (3). It
opens with the lock picks. Open the niche at (6) and the chest
at (7). Pick the lock at (9). Some players have found that to
pick this lock successfully you must use a character with at least
Rogue skill level 4. At (8) you will find a unicorn figurine.
Go to the wall at (12). Operating the button on the south wall
will open the east wall. Go to (16). Press the button on the east
wall. Do not press the button on the south wall. Go to (19). Shoot
or throw something at the button across the pit. Walk over the
illusory pit to the south. The niche here contains the carrion
key. Take it. You now have to jump into the pit and retrace many
of your steps. This time go to (20) and get the noir key from
the niche. Finally, go to (10). Open the lock with the noir key
and press the button inside the room. This will activate the teleport.
<P>
You will be transported to a new part of level 2. Take the stairs
up to level 3.
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
Explore as much of this level as possible without worrying about
difficult doors or chests. We will come to those later. The aim
is to map all the easy to get to places including and particularly
that nasty area where the missiles constantly bombard you. They
won't hurt you much so walk around the building here diligently
and try not to fall down the pits!
<P>
Now go to (6). At first all you will find here is a plaque telling
you &quot;the sum must be correct&quot;. Look at the automap.
Do you see the sum &quot;1 + 1 = 3&quot;? You must change the
three to a two.
<P>
Go to (4). Push the button to make the wall move to the west.
Follow the wall and push the other button. If you look at the
automap the sum should now be correct and the way to (6) should
be open. Don't fall down the pit here. Go to (6) and take the
human figurine from the niche. Put something you don't need in
the niche and push the buttons at both ends of the room. The wall
should open so that you can leave.
<P>
Go to (4) and jump down the pit to level 2.
<H2>LEVEL 2</H2>

<P>
Go to the lock at (17) with the carrion key and walk into the
room at (18). Here you will find King Richard. Put the four figurines
on the pedestals as follows to bend the light:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
Humanoid: right front 
Cobra:    left front 
Dragon:   right back 
Unicorn:  left back 
</PRE>

<P>
Now put a yellow pyramid key on each of the four corners of the
shroud. The game will help you put each key in the correct corner.
Now apply the crucible of faith (containing the elixir) to the
King. Give the King a weapon.
<P>
OK, now you have to go back to level 3. Go to (10), teleport to
the stairs area and go up to level 3.
<H2>LEVEL 3</H2>

<P>
Go through the secret wall to the chest at (2). Open it with the
lock picks. Open the niche at (3) and take the gold key. Go to
(11) and get the oily key. Go to (9) and get the death key. Open
the chest at (8) with the death key. Go to (7) and open the chest
with the oily key.
<P>
Go to (12). Read the instructions in each alcove and leave a suit
of armor, a weapon, a piece of jewelry (ring or necklace) and
a salve or herb in each appropriate alcove. The niche will open.
Take the dull key. Then collect up your pieces of equipment from
the four alcoves.
<P>
Open the chest at (10) with the dull key. Take the silver key,
in particular.
<P>
Go to (13). Open the keyholes by using the silver key on the left
lock and the gold key on the right lock. Push the button in between
the two locks and the wall will open.
<P>
Combine the ruby of truth and the shard of truth in the inventory
to make the whole truth!
<P>
Go to (14). Use the whole truth on Scotia as soon as she stops
talking. (Use the whole truth on her by clicking the right mouse
button as you hold the whole truth over your character.) Then
use the death wand on her a few times. This should do her in quite
quickly! If you don't have the death wand, hack her to pieces
instead!
<P>
As Scotia dies she threatens her death will not save you from
the wrath of the dark forces. Back at Gladstone, you are congratulated
and honored by the King, Dawn and Geron.
<P>
Now sit back and reminisce at the parade of monsters . . . so
you didn't kill all of them! Don't forget Scotia's threat!<HR>
