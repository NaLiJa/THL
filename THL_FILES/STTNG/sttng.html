<P>
This walkthru gives explicit instructions for playing Star Trek
The Next Generation: A Final Unity (FU) that lead to a successful
conclusion. The information given here assumes that the player
has read the game documentation included in the FU game box and
readme.txt.
<P>
Instructions are given for the Captain mode of difficulty. However,
it assumes you delegate all Tactical responsibilities to Worf
and Engineering responsiblities to La Forge or are able to manage
these activities yourself.<HR>

<H2><A NAME="hints">GENERAL HINTS</A></H2>

<OL>
<LI>Act cooperatively whenever there is an opportunity.
<LI>Never surrender to an enemy.
<LI>You can defeat one Romulan warbird easily, but not three.
Avoid the latter battle!
<LI>Question exhaustively. That is, do not end the conversation
prematurely. Select all the alternative questions and statements
before selecting the end of conversation statement. The exception
to this is Admiral Williams (Communication with Starfleet Command),
who will only provide new information only after you complete
each assignment.
<LI>Never ignore a hail. (You may do so during battles.)
<LI>Set course for the nearest Starbase to replenish Photon Torpedoes.
There are two starbases. Starbase 131 is in sector 01-03-01. Resume
your original course or return to your original location. Try
to time this so you are between assignments so as not to fail
a mission.
<LI>Save the game at every opportunity. There are four main reasons:
<UL>
<LI>You can lose the ship &amp; crew in battle.
<LI>I found the game crashed frequently and unpredictably.
<LI>It is easy to get stuck after having performed the wrong action.
<LI>You may complete the assignment, but when you check with Starfleet
they are not completely happy with your performance. You will
probably want to try again to do better.
</UL>
